## Movies_Database

Hello! I'm **Piotrek Szkopiak** and this is my training project to improve my skills for data science, specially - _database design_ and _database manipulation_. I use knowledge from _Codecademy_ tutorials :man_student:

### Overview

In this project I focus on _creating tables_ what can be easy join. Data of some of my favourite movies are from [Filmweb](https://www.filmweb.pl) and contains information about generals (title, category and rating), makers and staff. Primary goal is to split this data to 3 tables for better visual clarity and lower congestion of space:

> - [x] [Database Schema](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Movies_Database/blob/main/Movies_Database.sql)

> - [x] Database result as 3 `.csv` limited to 10 rows:

>> [Movies](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Movies_Database/blob/main/Movies.csv)

>> [Movie_Makers](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Movies_Database/blob/main/Movie_Makers.csv)

>> [Movie_Staff](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Movies_Database/blob/main/Movie_Staff.csv)
   
I use `pgAdmin 4` for `PostgreSQL`.

In future I want to increase amount of movies in my database for faster and more precise filtering movies for my relatives.
